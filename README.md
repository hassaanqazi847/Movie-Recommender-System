# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System

A simple **Movie Recommender System** built with **Python** and deployed using **Streamlit**.  
The system suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user, making it easier to discover new movies.  

This project demonstrates the use of **content-based recommendation** and how to deploy ML apps using Streamlit + Heroku.
