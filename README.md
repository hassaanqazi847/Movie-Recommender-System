A simple **Movie Recommender System** built with **Python** and deployed using **Streamlit**.  
The system suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user, making it easier to discover new movies.  

This project demonstrates the use of **content-based recommendation** and how to deploy ML apps using Streamlit + Heroku.

##  Project Overview

This project shows how **recommendation systems** work using movie data.  
It uses **cosine similarity** on features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords to recommend movies that are most similar to the selected one.  

The recommender is wrapped in a **Streamlit app** for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
